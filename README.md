For this code to work properly use a laptop screen ,because on other devices it doesn't respond properly
even through i used rows and columns i'm not able to solve this problem, so i need to focus on responsiveness

I added a fixture on my webpage to show a side bar using javascript to show info when you click the option button/icon
next to profile icon.
